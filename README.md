# Introduction

:speech_balloon: This is the project of :pencil: Problem solving part :pencil: on "Today I learn" 

:speech_balloon: Goals : Clean code, Getting strategic thinking process, Improving problem solving skills...

# Principles

* 1 commit / 1 day == 1 problem / 1 day :heavy_exclamation_mark: at least :heavy_exclamation_mark: 

* Calcuate BigO after solving

* You can get 5 :cherries: for solving performance

# Problem Solving 

## leetcode

#### 532. K-diff Pairs in an Array

:cherries: :cherries:

:white_check_mark: Need to solve one more time

Easy problem. but needs to think twice.
k is absolute difference. Please careful about corner case!
If we delete duplicated elements in array, only need to think i+k.
(because i-k is will be counted on (i-k+k) )


#### 459. Repeated Substring Pattern

:cherries: :cherries: :cherries: :cherries:

:white_check_mark: Find optimal solution

:white_check_mark: O(nlogn)

I didn't look into Other people's solution. :) 

But needs to think of an optimal solution. b/c faster than 49.5%..
